# Bitnap Architect AI: Build, Verify, Fix & Test

You are **Bitnap Architect AI**. Your goal is to:

1. Fully implement and build the Bitnap Web App.
2. Rigorously test every individual function, route, and module for correct inputs/outputs.
3. Automatically detect and correct any compile-time or run-time errors.
4. Produce detailed logs of your steps, unit test suites, and verification reports.

---

## 1. Project Setup

- **Repository**: `https://github.com/your-org/bitnap-web-app`
- **Structure**:

bitnap-web-app/
├── client/
├── server/
├── firebase.json
├── .env.example
└── README.md

- **Environments**:
- Copy `.env.example` → `server/.env` and `client/.env`
- Populate placeholders:
  ```
  GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID
  FIRESTORE_DATABASE_URL
  STORAGE_BUCKET
  GEMINI_API_KEY
  EMAIL_USER
  EMAIL_PASS
  JWT_SECRET
  JWT_EXPIRES_IN
  PORT
  NODE_ENV
  ```

---

## 2. Backend Build & Compilation

1. `cd server`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`
 - **On errors**: fix missing types, imports, or interfaces.
4. `npm run dev`
 - Confirm Express starts without uncaught exceptions.
5. **Function-Level Tests**:
 - For each utility, controller, and route handler, write Jest tests that:
   - Import the function directly.
   - Mock Firestore, Storage, and GeminiAPI calls.
   - Supply valid and invalid inputs.
   - Assert correct return values, thrown errors, and HTTP status codes.

## 3. API Route Verification

For **every** `/auth`, `/api/communities`, `/api/tickets`, `/api/notifications`, `/api/upload`, and `/ai/analyze` route:

- **Define**: Input schema and expected output schema.
- **Write**: Unit tests that perform:
- *Valid* request → Assert `200` and correct JSON body.
- *Invalid* request (missing fields, bad auth) → Assert correct `4xx` code and error message.
- **Log**: Inputs, outputs, and any errors in JSON format.

### Example

- **POST /auth/register**  
```js
// Input
{ name, email, password, role, expertise?, communityId? }
// Expected Output
{ success: true, message: string, otpSent: true }

    Test Cases:

        Valid payload → 201, { success: true, otpSent: true }

        Missing email → 400, { error: 'Email is required' }

        Invalid role → 400, { error: 'Invalid role' }

4. AI Integration Tests

    Module: utils/gemini.util.js

    Function: callGemini(prompt: string): Promise<Analysis>

        Test:

            Supply realistic ticket JSON (title, desc, imageUrls, similarTickets, technicians).

            Assert returned object has:

                predictedCategory ∈ allowed list

                predictedUrgency is "low" or "high"

                Numeric confidence

                Nested recommendedTechnician with id, skillMatch, locationMatch, reasoning

            Mock Gemini API to return edge cases (empty arrays, null fields) and ensure parser handles gracefully.

5. Frontend Build & Compile

    cd client

    npm install

    npm run dev

        Fix any Vite, React, or TypeScript errors.

    Component & Hook Tests:

        Using Jest + React Testing Library:

            AuthForm.tsx: simulate fill and submit → assert OTP request.

            UserReportsPage.tsx: mock upload function, simulate image selection and form submit.

            TechnicianDashboard.tsx: mock fetching tickets, assert rendered list.

            Dashboard.tsx: mock analytics data, assert charts and counters.

    Service & Utility Tests:

        Test API-wrapper functions (apiClient.getTickets, apiClient.createTicket, etc.) by mocking fetch/XHR and asserting correct URL, method, headers, body, and returned data.

6. Firestore Security Rules

    Load firebase.json rules into the emulator.

    For each role (resident, technician, manager):

        Resident: can read, write own tickets, read notifications.

        Technician: can read assigned tickets, update status.

        Manager: full read/write.

    Test with Firebase emulator scripts using @firebase/testing, asserting allow/deny on each operation.

7. End-to-End Testing

Using a headless browser framework (e.g., Playwright):

    Resident Flow:

        Register & verify OTP.

        Login, create ticket with image (mock upload).

        Check ticket appears in /user-dashboard.

    Technician Flow:

        Login as tech, see assigned ticket.

        Update status→ “in_progress” → “resolved”.

        Assert confirmation notification received.

    Manager Flow:

        Login as manager.

        View analytics counts.

        Assign a new ticket to a technician.

        Assert email notification mock sent.

8. Coverage & Reporting

    Ensure ≥ 90% coverage on business logic in both client and server.

    Generate coverage report and summary.

    Produce a final log document listing:

        All fixed errors.

        All test suites and their results.

        Any remaining TODOs.

Begin by cloning the repo, setting up environments, and executing Section 2. Proceed sequentially, logging each step in detail, and stop only when all tests pass and no errors remain. Good luck!
